                    <p>Welcome into my world.
                
I am Gedion Negash, a zealous student of software engineering at Addis Ababa University, very passionate about both front-end and back-end development. 
My technical toolset includes Python, Java, JavaScript, Dart, and C++, thus opening its way to create a large variety of innovative solutions.
<br><br>
I am good at back-end technologies such as Node.js, Django, MongoDB, SQL, Next.js, and RESTful APIs, which enable me to design scalable systems.
Also committed to mobile application development with Flutter, creating user-friendly, high-performance apps that exceed user expectations.
<br><br>
I am driven by lifelong learning and motivated intrinsically in my pursuit toward reducing complex problems into elegant and effective solutions.
Innovation and creativity stand at the very core of my passion for work, upon which exemplary software stands. More recently,
<br><br>  
I completed a course in Microsoft Azure Fundamentals through Demera Percipio by Skillsoft.
I am easy to communicate with and enjoy collaborating with people from diverse backgrounds.
I look forward to working on ambitious projects, turning bold ideas into reality. Let us begin and create something spectacular!
