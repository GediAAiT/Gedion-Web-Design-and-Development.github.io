                    <p>
                        During university, I had the opportunity to develop the website for Nova Entertainment. 
                        It was a large-scale platform where users could explore entertainment content such as videos,
                         music, movies, and sports. This project was both challenging and exciting.

                            <h3>Dynamic Layout</h3>
                            <p>In A past project, I designed the website's homepage for Nova Entertainment, 
                                with a pulsating and dynamic design to meet user experience needs. 
                                <br>
                                The homepage was to be well-designed to ensure featuring trending videos 
                                and Hollywood blockbuster movies alongside fireworks-thrilling sports highlights.
                                <br>
                                The layout was very attractive and user-friendly:- it allowed its visitors to surf through the site and enjoy the most viewed material. 
                                <br>
                                It included sections like most viewed videos, top-rated movies, and the most trending sports events on the front page, 
                                making the entertainment experience holistic and addictive. 
                                <br>
                                Creativity and technical expertise married up in this project for a very sleek and entertainingly perfect functioning platform.</p>

                                 SignUp page for Nova Entertainment was an entertainment platform developed for a university submission. 
                                It would be designed in such a way that it is user-friendly, 
                                <br>

                                <br>
                                The page had real-time validation, among other interactive things, right at the interaction level 
                                to make users frictionless,so they seamlessly transition to different types of personalized content on the platform.
